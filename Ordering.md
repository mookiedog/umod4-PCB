# Ordering From JCLPCB

## Basic Parts Versus Extended

JLCPCB has its own website for parts at https://jlcpcb.com/parts.
That website represents the subset of parts at LCSC.com which are available for use with JLCPCB's assembly service.
When the parts come up after searching, they will indicate whether they are basic or not.
There is also a filter checkbox that restricts the results to basic parts.
