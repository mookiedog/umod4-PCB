# Test Plan

Testing that needs to occur before a board spin:




1. __Pico W__
    
    1. __Micro SD card operation__
        1. I already know that the pinout should be fine. What I need to learn is what kind of performance I can expect.
    
    1. __LCD operation__ (SPI port)

    1. __RP2040 UART Connection__

    1. __PicoProbe SWD Control__

    1. __GPS operation, including PPS interrupts__
