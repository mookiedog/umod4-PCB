# Changelist for 4V2 PCB

## Problems With 4V1a

None so far.

## Critical Changes for 4V2

None so far.

## Proposed Enhancements and Changes for 4V2

1) __Add a test pad to measure CPU 1.1V supply__

    There is plenty of room by C15 to add a test pad and silkscreen

1) __Increase the size of R7__

    The new green "BSY" LED I had to spec is needlessly bright.
    Experiments will be needed to see what a suitable resistor would be.

1) __Need Bigger Drill for Keystone 4952 test points__

    The Keystone 1035 test points fit OK with their current drill size.
    The Keystone 4952 test points need a bigger hole than the 1035.
    Check if the 4952 test point has the right size drill in the library.
